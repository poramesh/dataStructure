Priority Queue Using Heaps (Min-Heap and Max-Heap)


Min-Heap (smaller number = higher priority)

min_pq = []
for num in [10, 40, 20, 5]:
    heapq.heappush(min_pq, num)

print("Min Priority Queue:", min_pq)
print("Deleted element with highest priority (min):", heapq.heappop(min_pq))


Max-Heap (larger number = higher priority)

max_pq = []
for num in [10, 40, 20, 5]:
    heapq.heappush(max_pq, -num)  # Python heapq is min-heap, so we invert values

print("Max Priority Queue:", [-x for x in max_pq])
print("Deleted element with highest priority (max):", -heapq.heappop(max_pq))
