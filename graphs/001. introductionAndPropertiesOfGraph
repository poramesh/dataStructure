datastructure are the ways to arrange data.
graph is another non linear data structure and has a wide no of scenarios in computer science.

graph is a collection of objects or entities that we call nodes or vertices, connected to each other through
a set of edges but in a tree connections are bond to be in a certain way, in a tree with n nodes we must have
exactly n minus 1 edges, one edge for each parent-child relationship as we know an edge in a tree is for a parent-
child relationship and all nodes in a tree except the root node would have a parent would have exactly one
parent and that's why if there are n nodes there must be exactly n minus 1 edges in a tree all nodes must be reachable from the root 

in graph, there are no rules dictating the connection among the nodes, a graph contains a set of nodes and a set of edges and edges can be
connecting nodes in any possible way. 
tree is only a special kind of graph. now graph as a concept has been studied extensively in maths.(discrete mathematics)

a graph G is an ordered pair of a set V of vertices and a set E of edges.

G=(V,E)

an ordered pair is just a pair of mathematical objects in which the order of objects in the pair matters.

V is the first object in the pair and E is the second object. 
an ordered pair (a,b) is not equal to (b,a) if a is not equal to b.

we have unordered pair, where order is not an important. 
{a,b} = {b,a}

v = {v1,v2,v3,v4,v5,v6,v7,v8}

the edge is uniquely identifief by its two endpoint.
edges can be directed(one ways like tree) or undirected(two ways)

directed:
(first one can be origin, second one can be destination)
(u,v)
undirected:
{u,v}

E= {{v1,v2},{v1,v3},{v1,v4},{v2,v5},{v2,v6},{v3,v7},{v4,v8},{v7,v8},{v5,v8},{v6,v8}}

would either be directed/undirected. the graph could have both directed or undirected.

a directed graph or di-graph / uni directional/ ordered pairs
an undirected graph / bi directional / unordered pairs 


many real world system can be modeled using graph. any collection of objects have pair wise relatiobship.

1. social network .
if two users are friends then there will be edge connected them.
social network is undirected graph, if we are friends tehn it will be mutual. so connection has be two ways.
once the system has been modeled as a graph, a lot of problems can easily be solved by app;ying standatad algorithms in graph theory.

let's say we want to suggest some connections to an user named rama one possible approach to do so can be suggesting
friends of friends who are not connected already Rama has three friends Ella, Bob and Katie and friends of these three
that are not connected to Rama already can be suggested.

finding all nodes having length of shortest path from rama equal to 2


2. web pages.
interlinked web pages on the internet or the world wide web can be represented as a directed graph of web page that would
have a unique address or URL would be a node in the graph and we can have a directed edge if a page contains link to
another page now once again there are billions of pages on the web, here the edges are directed because
relationship is not mutual this time if page a has a link to page b then its not necessary that page b will also have
a link to page. 
we can apply standaard graph theory algo to solve problems. 
web crawling search engines use a program called web carwler that systematically browses the worldwide web to collect and store data about
web pages. search engines can then use this data to provde quick and accueate results against search queries.
web crawling is basically a graph traversal, the act of visting all nodes in the graph.

weighted vs unweighted.

3.highways and roads
the network of highways and freeways between cities as an undirected graph I am assuming that all highways
would be bi-directional. intra-city road network that is road network within a city would definitely have one-way roads
nd so intra-city road network must be represented as a directed graph but intercity road network in my opinion can
be represented as an undirected graph.
we can label the link of the node with kms. and we can recommend the shorted path based on the different weights assigned.

unweighted graph: a weighted graph with all edges having weight = 1 unit.  

weighted and directed graph = intracity road network.
highway - directed and directed grap.
werld wide web  - unweighted and un directed graph.
social media - unweighted and udirected graph
