      0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
0   | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

0 means self loop
row is start point
col is end point

0 is taking up the extra memory there will be a lot of 0s so it will be sparse.

for a social network with a billion(10^9) users:
row size = 10^9

if i have 1000 friends
then no of 1s = 1000 (1kb)
no of 0s will be 10^9-1000 (1 gb)

0 is redunant info/extra memory

we can just have a list of node tahts connected.
{1,2,3} or {b,c,d}
lets just store the indices then the name.

 0  1  2
+--+--+--+
 1  2  3

in earlier implementaion, index was represeting the index of node  in the graph, value represented if there was a conenction

here index doesnt represent anything. the value are actual indices of the nodes to which we are connected.
instead of array we shall use linked list.

   A -- B
 / |    / \
C   D   E  F 
\    \ /  /
  G -- H

we can also use tree, like bst. 

  +---+---+---+
0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
  +---+---+---+
1 | 0 | 4 | 5 |
  +---+---+---+
2 | 0 | 6 | 
  +---+---+
3 | 0 | 7 | 
  +---+---+
4 | 1 | 7 |

5 | 1 | 7 |

1th node is connected to 0th,4th,5th.

here we are consuming a lot less memory.

we can create array of pointers of array of 8.
 int *A[8];
A[0] = new int[3];
A[1] = new int[3];
A[2] = new int[2];
....
A[7] = new int[4];

space consumption is proportional to no of edges. 
in most graphs e<<v^2

for undirected graph we will consuming exactly 2*e memory.

finding if two nodes are connected or not?
here we have to scan through row.

when we have to find if there is connection between 0 to 7 then we will have to perform linear search on 0th row.

we can keep it all sorted and perform binary search.

O(v) - linear search 
and O(logv) - binary search


                      2d array   list
            
finding adjacent nodes   O(v)    O(v)

finding if two nodes      O(1)   O(v)
are conencted 


we are not saving much on time but still when we are dealing with sparse graph, then it woudlnt be so worse case. 

for a social network with billion users:

if max no of friends = 10^4

if machine can scan 10^6 cells/second

                        2d array                        list
            
finding adjacent nodes   10^9/10^6=1000sec=16.6min          10^4/10^6=10^-2 = 10 ms

finding if two nodes      1/10^6 sec 1ms to read that one cell      10ms(we need to scan a row since we dont) 
are conencted            which we know what to scan                       exact cell


machine cant make users wwait for so much time 
it does save time and space, when graph is sparse.


what would we do if graph changes?
what if there is new edges is inserted or deleted?

flip the zero to in if its on 2D array.
if it was deletion then make the 1 -> 0

in the second structure, we just need to add the new edge in the row

adding is not easy in the arrays, if the arrray size is not enough.

this is the reasion why we use linked list.

struct node{
int data;
struct node* next;
};
struct node *A[8];


A[0] -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> NULL
A[1] -> 0 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
A[2] -> 0 -> 6 -> NULL
A[3] -> 0 -> 7 -> NULL
A[4] -> 1 -> 7 -> NULL
A[5] -> 1 -> 7 -> NULL
A[6] -> 2 -> 7 -> NULL
A[7] -> 3 -> 6 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL


what we have here is adjanceny list.
if we had wieght then it will have antoher field, int weight;


space complexity: O(E+V)
               E<< V*V assming it is sparse matrix.

what if we add new connection/delete new connection?

what if instead of linked list to store all the infor about all neighbours  we use binary search tree?
do u think we would do better, cause time cost for searching, inserting and deleting a neighbour would reduce.


WITH THIS THOUGHT I WILL SIGN OFF, THIS IS IT FOR THIS LESSON

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TEACHING.
