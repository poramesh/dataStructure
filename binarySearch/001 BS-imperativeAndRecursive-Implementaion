given array in a sorted array(decreassing order):

 A 2 6 13 21 36 47 63 81 97

 we need to check if value exists in the array

 x = 81 ? exists(7)
 x = 25 ? no

search(A,n,x){
 for i = 0 to n -1 
    if A[i] == x
      return i

return -1
}


best case: 1 comparisons
worst case: n comparisons

another approach:

x = 13

we will compare it with middle elmenet.

case 1: x == A[mid]
case 2: x < A[mid]
case 3: x > A[mid]


start = 0
end = len(arr)
mid = (start+end)/2


 A   2 | 6| 13| 21| 36| 47| 63| 81| 97|
     0   1  2   3   4   5   6   7   8

find elemenet 13 

first iteration:
s = 0, e =8, mid = 4
13==36? 0
13 < 36? 1
-> s=0, e = 3(one less than middle ele), m = 1
second iteration:
13== 6? 0
13<6? 0
13>6?1 
-> s=2(one more mid), e = 3, m = 2
13==13? 1 (found)


 A   2 | 6| 13| 21| 36| 47| 63| 81| 97|
     0   1  2   3   4   5   6   7   8

find elemenet 14 

first iteration:
s = 0, e =8, mid = 4
14==36? 0
14 < 36? 1
-> s = 0, e = 3(one less than middle ele), m = 1
second iteration:
14 == 6? 0
14 < 6? 0
14 > 6? 1 
-> s = 2(one more mid), e = 3, m = 2
14 == 13? 0 
14 < 13 ? 1
-> s = 3, e = 2, m = 2 (exit condition)


binarySearch(A, n, x)
{
   start = 0
   end = n-1
   while(start<=end){
      mid = start+end /2
      if A[mid] == x
         return mid
      else if x < A[mid]{
      end = mid-1
      }
      else if x>A[mid]{
      start = mid+1
      }
   }
   return -1
}


best case: 1 comparison
n -> n/2 -> n/4 ......n/2^k = 1 => k = logn

iterative implementation and common errors when overflow may occur:
__________________________________________



#include<stdio.h>

int bs(int a[],int n, int x){
while (low<=high)
{
    int low=0, high = n-1;
    int mid = (low+high)/2; or int mid = low + (high -low) /2; (low+high) may overflow
    if(x==A[mid]) return mid;
    else if(x < A[mid]) high = mid-1;
    else low = mid+1;
}
return -1;
}

int main(){
  int A[] = {2,4,5,7,14,12,56};
  int ele;
  printf("enter the number to search");
  scanf("%s", &ele);
  int size = A.size() 
  int index = bs(A,size, ele );
  if index!==1 printf("element found at index %d", index);
  else printf("element not found");
}


__________________________
Recursive implementation
___________________________

this is a good example of divide and conquer alogirthm.


int binarySearch(int a[],low,high,x){
    if(low>high) return -1; //exit condition
    mid = low+(high-low)/2;
    if (a[mid] == x) return mid; //base condition
    else if(x<a[mid]) return binarySearch(a,low,mid-1,x);
    else return binarySearch(a,mid+1,high,x);
}
return -1;
}

since return statement is used, it goes back to its called fucntion once exeuction is completed,
it returns -1 on its way.

0log(n)

which implementation is better? iterative may seem a good approach if no need of storing the state of fucntion or data 
in the memory while recursive calls happens.
anything that we can implement recursion we can write it using iteration.anything that we can wrrite using
iteration can be wrriten using recursion.



Let’s say you are searching for x = 6 in the array a = [1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12]. So low = 0, high = 6.


Now suppose you're searching for x = 9:


binarySearch(a, 0, 6, 9)
    mid = 3 → a[3] = 7 → 9 > 7 → go right

    └── binarySearch(a, 4, 6, 9)
          mid = 5 → a[5] = 11 → 9 < 11 → go left

          └── binarySearch(a, 4, 4, 9)
                mid = 4 → a[4] = 9 → match found → return 4


Now suppose you're searching for x = 9:

binarySearch(a, 0, 6, 10)
    mid = 3 → a[3] = 7 → 10 > 7 → go right

    └── binarySearch(a, 4, 6, 10)
          mid = 5 → a[5] = 11 → 10 < 11 → go left

          └── binarySearch(a, 4, 4, 10)
                mid = 4 → a[4] = 9 → 10 > 9 → go right

                └── binarySearch(a, 5, 4, 10)
                      low > high → return -1 (not found)
