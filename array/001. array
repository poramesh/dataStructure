 An array is a type of data structure that stores elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. In an array, A, of size N, each memory location has some unique index, i (where 0<=i<N), that can be referenced as A[i] or Ai.

Reverse an array of integers.


Example
A=[1,2,3]
Return[3,2,1]

Function Description
Complete the function reverseArray in the editor below.
reverseArray has the following parameter(s):
int A[n]: the array to reverse
Returns
int[n]: the reversed array
Input Format

The first line contains an integer, N, the number of integers in A.
The second line contains N space-separated integers that make up A.

Constraints
1<=N<=10^3
1<=A[i]<=10^4, where A[i] is the ith integer in A
                 
Solution:

N = int(input())
A = input().split()
ans = ""
for i in range(N):
    ans += A[N-i-1]+" "
    
print(ans[0:-1])//print()ans[0:]

(or)
print(' '.join(A[::-1]))


(or)
n = int(input())

ar = input().split()

rev = [0]*n
j = n-1
for i in range(len(ar)):
    rev[j] = ar[i]
    j=j-1
    
res = ' '.join(map(str,rev)) //join() method is used to concatenate elements of an iterable (like a list) into a single string,with the specified separator between each element.
print(res)

(or)

N = input()
A = [int(x) for x in input().split()] //int
#A = input().split() // store as list
#A = input() #store its as str
###
text = "IBM HackerRank test"
words = text.split()
print(words)  # ['IBM', 'HackerRank', 'test']
###
A = input().split() #list


print(' '.join([str(x) for x in reversed(A)]))
