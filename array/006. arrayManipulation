Starting with a 1-indexed array of zeros and a list of operations, for each operation add a value to each the array element between two given indices, inclusive. Once all operations have been performed, return the maximum value in the array.

Example
n=10
queries =[[1,5,3],[4,8,7],[6,9,1]]

Queries are interpreted as follows:

    a b k
    1 5 3
    4 8 7
    6 9 1
Add the values of k between the indices a and b inclusive:

index->     1 2 3  4  5 6 7 8 9 10
    [0,0,0, 0, 0,0,0,0,0, 0]
    [3,3,3, 3, 3,0,0,0,0, 0]
    [3,3,3,10,10,7,7,7,0, 0]
    [3,3,3,10,10,8,8,8,1, 0]
The largest value is of 10 after all operations are performed.

Function Description
arrayManipulation has the following parameters:

int n - the number of elements in the array
int queries[q][3] - a two dimensional array of queries where each queries[i] contains three integers, a, b, and k.
Returns

int - the maximum value in the resultant array

Input Format
The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m, the size of the array and the number of operations.
Each of the next m lines contains three space-separated integers a,b and k, the left index, right index and summand.

Constraints
3<=n<=10^7
1<=m<=2*10^5
1<=a<=b<=n
0<=k<=10^9

Sample Input

5 3
1 2 100
2 5 100
3 4 100
Sample Output
200

Explanation

After the first update the list is 100 100 0 0 0.
After the second update list is 100 200 100 100 100.
After the third update list is 100 200 200 200 100.

The maximum value is 200.


arrSize, n = map(int,input().split(" "))
#arrSize = arrSize+1
arr=[0]*arrSize
for _ in range(n):
    a,b,value=map(int,input().split(" "))
    for i in range(a-1,b):
        arr[i]=value+arr[i]
print(max(arr))


We can try to understand this logic like we imagine Supermario walking on a N width horiz line. 
a and b is the point on the line, k is the mushroom Mario always like to eat. 
When Mario go to the point at a,he eat the k size mushroom and become taller,
after he have walked through point b, his height reverse to the origin height before he eat the mushroom.
eg. 
1. When Mario is walking to a, he eat a k size mushroom, and become k bigger 
2. Then Mario is walking to a', he eat a k' size mush, and become k' bigger, now Mario's height is (k + k') 
3. If Mario have walked to b, so he pooped out the mushroom and become k smaller, the only way that he can become larger is to meet a new (a,b) point and eat a new k size mushroom
4. The rest can be done in the same manner.

What we need to do is tracing the Mario's biggest height when walking through that muliple query's a and b point.


arrSize, n = map(int,input().split(" "))
max = 0
x=0
arrSize = arrSize+1
arr=[0]*arrSize
for _ in range(n):
    a,b,value=map(int,input().split(" "))
    arr[a]=value+arr[a]
    if b+1<arrSize: arr[b+1]=arr[b+1]-value

    

for i in range(1,arrSize):
    x = x + arr[i]
    if x>max:
        max=x
        

print(max)

def arrayManipulation(n, queries):
    params = {}
    max_value = 0

    for query in queries:
        q_start, q_end, q_val = query

        # Update starting point
        params[q_start] = params.get(q_start, 0) + q_val
        # Update ending point + 1
        params[q_end + 1] = params.get(q_end + 1, 0) - q_val

    sum_val = 0

    # Calculate the prefix sum and find the maximum value
    for i in sorted(params.keys()):
        sum_val += params[i]
        if sum_val > max_value:
            max_value = sum_val

    return max_value

    ch[b+1]-=k

    v+=ch[i]
    m=max(m,v)

    a, b, k = map(int, input().split())
    queries[2*i] = (a, 1, k)
    queries[2*i+1] = (b, 2, -k)
queries.sort() //

current = 0
for q in queries:
    if q[1] == 1:
        current += q[2]
        ans = max(current, ans)
    else:
        #ans = max(current, ans) not needed
         current += q[2]
print ans

Your Output (stdout)
queries = [(1, 1, 100), (2, 2, -100), (2, 1, 100), (5, 2, -100), (3, 1, 100), (4, 2, -100)]
sort(queries) = [(1, 1, 100), (2, 1, 100), (2, 2, -100), (3, 1, 100), (4, 2, -100), (5, 2, -100)]



Another simple solution that passes all tests is like following:

For the input

    1 5 3
    4 8 7
    6 9 1
Sort the parameters: 1 5 4 8 6 9 -> sort -> 1 4 5 6 8 9

You get the following sequence: (1 (4 5) (6 8) 9)

Then add values: (+3 (+7 -3) (+1 -7) -1)

Sum up the values 3, 10, 7, 8, 1, 0

The maximum value 10 is the result.

One additional moment is to handle identical params with different values. For them order should be descending.
