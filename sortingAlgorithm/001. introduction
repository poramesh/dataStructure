Introduction to Sorting Algorithms

1. Importance of Sorting:
Sorting helps in organizing data for better readability and faster searching.
Examples: arranging cards in hand, sorting hotel options by price or rating, dictionaries, medal tallies.

2. Definition of Sorting:
Arranging elements in increasing or decreasing order based on a specific property.
Lists should be homogeneous (same type of elements).

3. Common Use Case:
Sorting a list of integers in increasing or decreasing order.
Sorting can also be done based on custom properties like number of factors, guest ratings, lexicographic order, etc.

4. Sorted Data and Searching:
Unsorted data requires Linear Search (O(n) time).
Sorted data enables Binary Search (O(log n) time), which is significantly faster.

5. Real-World Implication:
Large datasets benefit from sorting due to reduced computation time when performing searches.

6. Sorting Algorithms to Study:
Basic: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort.
Efficient: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort.
Non-Comparison Based: Counting Sort, Radix Sort.
Many more exist beyond these.

7. Classification Parameters:
Time Complexity: Efficiency of the algorithm as data size increases.
Space Complexity: Amount of extra memory used.
Stability: Maintains relative order of elements with equal keys.
Internal vs External Sort: Based on whether sorting is done in RAM or external storage.
Recursive vs Non-Recursive: Based on the algorithm's design.
