How do we consider all different combinations of indices in general?


What are "combinations of indices"?
If you have a list of length n:
arr = [a, b, c, d]
The indices are: 0, 1, 2, 3.

Now, if you want to try every possible group of k distinct indices, say k = 2, you want:
(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3)

These are combinations: order doesn't matter, no repetitions.


How do we generate them ourselves?
Let’s say n = 4, k = 2.
We want to choose 2 indices out of 0 to 3 — without repeats, and in increasing order (to avoid duplicates).

Basic recursive idea:
At each step:
1. Pick the next index (must be greater than the last one).
2. Add it to a temporary list (path).
3. Repeat until length k.


Simple example: n = 4, k = 2

def generate_combinations(start, path):
    if len(path) == 2:
        print(path)
        return

    for i in range(start, 4):
        generate_combinations(i + 1, path + [i])

generate_combinations(0, [])


  generate_combinations(start=0,path=[]):
  if len(path) ==2 : no

  for 0 in range(0,4):      
    generate_combinations()
