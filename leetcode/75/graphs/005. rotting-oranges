You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:

0 representing an empty cell,
1 representing a fresh orange, or
2 representing a rotten orange.
Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4

        2 1 1
        1 1 0
        0 1 1

        00 01 02
        10 11 12
        20 21 22
1:
        2  2  1
        2  1  0
        0  1  1
2:
        2  2  2
        2  2  0
        0  1  1
3:
        2  2  2
        2  2  0
        0  2  1
4:
        2  2  2
        2  2  0
        0  2  2

          

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.

Example 3:
Input: grid = [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.

rotting changes since rotting is added only if it exists in the fresh
