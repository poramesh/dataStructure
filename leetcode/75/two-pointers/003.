If the array height = [1, 3, 2, 5], the ith line represents:

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints
of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

For: 𝑖 = 0, the line is from (0,0) to (0,1).
For: 𝑖 = 1, the line is from (1,0) to (1,3).
For: 𝑖 = 2, the line is from (2,0) to (2,2).
For: 𝑖 = 3, the line is from (3,0) to (3,5).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.






JUST PUTTING IT OUT HERE CAUSE I MANAGED TO CAME UP W THIS SOLUTION BUT IT DOESNT PASS ALL THE TEST CASES SO I AM NOT ENTIRELY HAPPE.

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        i=0
        n = len(height)
        max_water = -inf
        while(i<n):
            w=0
            j=i
            while (j<n):
                if(height[i]>height[j]):
                    val = height[j]*w
                else: 
                    val = height[i]*w
                
                if(val>max_water):
                    max_water = val
                
                w+=1
                j+=1
            
            i+=1
        
        return max_water

THE TRICK IS NOT THE HEIGHT, IT IS THE WIDTH.

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height):
        i, j = 0, len(height) - 1
        water = 0
        while i < j:
            water = max(water, (j - i) * min(height[i], height[j]))
            if height[i] < height[j]:
                i += 1
            else:
                j -= 1
        return water
