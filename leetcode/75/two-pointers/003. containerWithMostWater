If the array height = [1, 3, 2, 5], the ith line represents:

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints
of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

For: 𝑖 = 0, the line is from (0,0) to (0,1).
For: 𝑖 = 1, the line is from (1,0) to (1,3).
For: 𝑖 = 2, the line is from (2,0) to (2,2).
For: 𝑖 = 3, the line is from (3,0) to (3,5).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.







THE TRICK IS NOT THE HEIGHT, IT IS THE WIDTH.

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height):
        i, j = 0, len(height) - 1
        water = 0
        while i < j:
            water = max(water, (j - i) * min(height[i], height[j]))
            if height[i] < height[j]:
                i += 1
            else:
                j -= 1
        return water
