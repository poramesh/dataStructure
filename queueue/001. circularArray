Introduction to Queues:
It is FIFO(first in first out)
A list or collection with the restriction that insertion can be performed at one end (rear) and deletion can be performed at the other end(front).
operations
1. enqueue(x) or push(x)
2. dequeue() or pop()
3. front() or peek()
4. isempty()

application: printer queue, process schelduing, simulating wait.

front and rear will be poiting to empty that is -1, when we enque a value both front and rear will be incrememneted,
, and after we enqueue another value, we will only increment rear end.
when we dequeue oepration we will incremenet front(since the cell is not part of the array, it doesnt mater what value is present).


as we traverse the array, we might reach the end of the cell that is last index in array, during that time it would be a good idea to use circular array.
we can use modulo operation.


current positionor rear = i
next position = (i+1)%n
previous postition = (i+n-1)%n #addig n so it is always positive.
printing=(first+rear%n)
count = (rear+n-front)%n+1
