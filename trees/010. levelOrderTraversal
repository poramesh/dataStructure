BFS -> F,D,J,B,E,G,K,A,C,I,H
BFS is also called level order traversal. here we visit all its children before visiitng any of its grandchildrens

we can make use of Queue, to traverse the level order traversal.
we basically push the root node, then enter the while loop and it calls until q is empty. each time when
we enter the loop we visit /print the data and insertt the adress of the left and right child.
isnt this amazing??

time complexity is O(n) all cases
space compelxity is O(n) worst/avg O(1) - best
