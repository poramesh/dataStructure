BST  

how do we create non linear logical structure in computer memory.
we can use dynmaically created nodes taht we create jst like we for for linked list.

struct node{
int data;
node* left;
node* right;
}
we had a similar implementation for doubly linked list, one for prev node and one for net node.
but this one is for BST which is non linear.
nodes will be created in head using malloc function in c or new operator in c++.

struct bstNode{
int data;
struct bstNode* left;
struct bstNode* right;
}
struct bstNode* rootPtr; //to store adress of root node.
