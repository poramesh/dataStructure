1. HCF (Highest Common Factor)
HCF of two or more numbers is the largest number that divides all of them exactly (i.e., without leaving a remainder). It’s also called GCD (Greatest Common Divisor).

How to find HCF:
List the factors of each number.
Find the common factors.
The largest one is the HCF.

Example:
Find HCF of 12 and 18.
Factors of 12 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}
Factors of 18 = {1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18}
Common factors = {1, 2, 3, 6}
HCF = 6


  
2. LCM (Least Common Multiple)
LCM of two or more numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the given numbers.

How to find LCM:
List the multiples of each number.
Find the first (smallest) common multiple.

Example:
Find LCM of 4 and 5.
Multiples of 4 = 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, ...
Multiples of 5 = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...
Common multiples = {20, 40, ...}
LCM = 20

Relationship between HCF and LCM
For any two numbers a and b:
HCF(a,b)×LCM(a,b) = a×b
Example:
Let’s take a = 12, b = 18
HCF = 6
LCM = 36
Check:
6 × 36 = 216
12 × 18 = 216 




  We can implement this logic using math module in python


import math

a = 12
b = 18

# HCF (GCD)
hcf = math.gcd(a, b)

# LCM
lcm = abs(a * b) // hcf # we do absolute here cause negatice doesnt make sense, 

print(f"HCF: {hcf}")
print(f"LCM: {lcm}")



  
why floor division // instead of / normal division?

/ returns a float, even when the result is a whole number.
// returns an integer, which is what we want for LCM and HCF.


why abs()?

The HCF (Highest Common Factor) or GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) is always defined as a non-negative integer — typically positive or zero (when both numbers are zero).
Even if the inputs are negative, the HCF is considered positive.

math.gcd(12, 18)     # 6
math.gcd(-12, 18)    # 6
math.gcd(-12, -18)   # 6
math.gcd(0, 18)      # 18
math.gcd(0, 0)       # 0





  Implementaion using Euclidean Algo:


def find_hcf(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x

def find_lcm(x, y):
    hcf = find_hcf(x, y)
    return abs(x * y) // hcf

# Example usage
a = 12
b = 18

print("HCF:", find_hcf(a, b))  # Output: 6
print("LCM:", find_lcm(a, b))  # Output: 36
